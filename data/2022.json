DJs will mix Chow playlists from 2000 onwards, present a sake cocktail list at early 2000s prices and we may even see some Hoegardens and Fernet Brancas wheeled out.","event_title":"Tory-Yaki: 21 years on Tory","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5216","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-03-02 08:19:40","modified":"2022-05-09 07:26:58","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"740","venue_id":"153","reference_num":"","title":"Burger Wellington - Chow","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"58","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/AI5_-Bhaji-Bun-anza-chow-220329-130943.jpg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5216-burger-wellington-chow","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"#restaurant #food #foodie #foodporn #instafood #dinner #foodlover #delicious #foodphotography #yummy #bar #foodstagram #lunch #instagood #chef #foodblogger #cafe #love #hotel #foodies #tasty #wine #eat #delivery #travel #foodgasm #restaurante #healthyfood #bhfyp\r\nvegan, plant based, fresh, healthy, #date-night, cocktails, Asian-fusion, under $20, cheap eats, night out, food-porn, delicious, foodies, delivery, lunch, dinner, late-night, chicken, butter chicken, onion bhaji, curry,","total_price_for_burger_beer_match":"25","select_your_garage_project_beer_match":"Golden Path","has_beer_match":["Yes"],"does_your_burger_offering_cater_to_please_leave_blank_if_you_cannot_cater_to_these_dietaries":["Dairy Free","Nut Free","Vegan_possible"],"are_bookings_required":"Not required, but can be made","will_you_be_offering_your_burger_for_takeaway_orders":"Yes","are_you_happy_for_customers_to_share_burgers":"Yes","availability":["Lunch","Dinner"],"burger_price":"15","burger_description":"Chicken fillet with lettuce, Punjabi pickled onion and Grafter\u2019s Honey butter chicken sauce in a Pandoro sesame seed potato bun, with onion bhaji fries and tamarind chutney\r\n\r\nVegetarian\/vegan alternative: potato patty, no honey","are_fries_included":["Yes - Fries\/Side"],"what_is_the_main_protein_of_your_burger":["Chicken"],"name_of_burger":"The Bhaji Bun-anza","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5227","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-03-02 10:07:43","modified":"2022-05-23 12:43:23","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"740","venue_id":"153","reference_num":"","title":"Cocktail Wellington - chow","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"57","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/HERO_-for-flux-sake-chow-220329-131024-220523-124323.jpg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5227-cocktail-wellington-chow","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"#restaurant #food #foodie #foodporn #instafood #dinner #foodlover #delicious #foodphotography #yummy #bar #foodstagram #lunch #instagood #chef #foodblogger #cafe #love #foodies #tasty #wine #eat #delivery #travel #foodgasm #restaurante #healthyfood #bhfyp\r\nvegan, plant based, fresh, healthy, #date-night, cocktails, under $20, cheap eats, night out, food-porn, delicious, foodies, delivery, lunch, dinner, late-night,","is_your_cocktail_and_tapas_offering":["Dairy Free","Gluten Free","Nut Free","Vegan_possible","Vegetarian"],"price_of_mocktail_tapas_match":"18","description_of_mocktail_and_regionally_inspired_tapas_match":"Libertine Blends Kapow tea and watermelon infused non-alcoholic gin, rice vinegar shrub, Apostle coconut hot sauce, salted cucumber and mint topped with Plimmerton Berry kombucha.

Chocolate Factory chocolate, Awatoru Wild Foods and Brooklyn Creamery goat's milk","wellington_story":"With Wellington being the capital, the political landscape has a huge impact on the city - you never quite know what's coming next, what effect local politics have, and does that promise made really mean what you think it does? How much honey is actually in the beehive, or is it all just hot air?

His formal French cuisine training helps chef Prat give every dish a modern touch while still keeping it authentic to his roots.\r\n\r\nChef Bibin's background in ecology and biodiversity couldn't win over his love for food. Growing up in his father's restaurant, taught Bibin everything he knows about Indian food. Kerala is known as the land of spices and that's exactly what you will explore throughout Bibin's dishes.\r\n\r\nChef Brigitta hails from Indonesia where the influence of Indian food is everywhere.

Divided into three distinct groups based on location and origin myths, all have adapted their original cuisines to local ingredients and influences whilst upholding kosher laws.\r\n\r\nThe Cochin Jews arrived on the Malabar Coast, Kerala, in around 50 CE and are seen as one of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Reflecting \u2018the land of spices\u2019 and its rich trading heritage, their cuisine is a meeting of cultures dominated by spices.\r\n\r\nThe Bene Israel community settled on the West Coast of India, near Mumbai, around the 2nd century and lived as oil pressers and farmers. Characterised by the cooking of the local Maharashtra people their dishes are spicy and aromatic, making use of abundant fish, with ample chilli and turmeric.\r\n\r\nMore recently, around 250 years ago, the Baghdadi Jews came from the Middle East settling in West Bengal near Kolkata. Baghdadi cooking is a hybrid, adding Indian spices to Iraqi and Syrian dishes of potatoes, raisins and tamarind.\r\n\r\nThe menu will showcase a collection of Indian Jewish dishes from each of these communities. Come and experience this delicious confluence of cuisine.","event_title":"Kosher & Spice","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0}]},{"Venue":{"id":"1381","region":"Upper Hutt\u2028\u2028","reference_num":null,"aisle_number":null,"type":"","description":"Tucked away in a leafy green suburb, Fig Tree Caf\u00e9 is renown for its lofty ceilings and spacious setting in a beautifully restored chapel.

Wolf at Foxglove is the newest addition to the story of the grand old Greta Point Tavern. The building was one of the original and last remaining steamship wharf buildings converted into a tavern at Greta Point in the late 19th century. Destined for demolition, a plan was hatched to save it by cutting into 12 parts and relocating it by boat to its current site on the Wellington waterfront. Requiring a massive labour force, they relied on the goodwill of the people of Wellington, support from the industry, friends and a whole lot of Wellington ingenuity. To acknowledge that forward-thinking, invention, collaboration and spirit, Foxglove joined up with their friends at Southward Distilling to create our own little bit of history and bottle their first batch of whiskey. This whiskey plays a part in the aging process of Foxglove\u2019s signature beef dish for this year.","dish_name":"To the Last Drop","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5014","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-02-22 09:59:10","modified":"2022-05-19 07:35:20","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"790","venue_id":"468","reference_num":"","title":"Foxglove\/ Wolf Cocktail","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"57","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/FOXGLOVE_COCKTAIL_WOAP2022-220519-073520.jpg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5014-foxglove-wolf-cocktail","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"cream, gin, herbal, smoke, sweet, donut, orange, caramel, bubble","is_your_cocktail_and_tapas_offering":"","price_of_mocktail_tapas_match":"18","description_of_mocktail_and_regionally_inspired_tapas_match":"Non-alcoholic gin, honey and pear cordial, soda, chantilly cream and a rosemary smoke bubble.

A complimentary custom-blend alcoholic beverage will be served during the event.","event_title":"Foraged with Vicky Ha: Dumplings 101","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0}]},{"Venue":{"id":"45","region":"Wellington CBD\u2028","reference_num":null,"aisle_number":null,"type":"Festival Event Host","description":"","created":"2017-02-01 13:03:42","modified":"2017-02-01 13:03:42","enabled":false,"title":"House of Dumplings","abn":null,"address1":"117 Taranaki St","address2":"Te Aro ","suburb":"Wellington CBD","postcode":"6011","phone":"027 302 3309","contact_person":"Vicky Ha","website":"houseofdumplings.co.nz","twitter":"@dumplingnz","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Dumplingnz\/","instagram":"dumplings_nz","tiktok":"","email":"info@houseofdumplings.co.nz","image":null,"ll":"-41.2953439, 174.77745600000003","user_id":"587","site_id":"5","public_link":"\/venue\/45\/house-of-dumplings","wheelchair_access":"0","takes_bookings":"n\/a","billing_address":"117 Taranaki Street\r\nTe Aro\r\nWellington 6011","open__sun":"0","open_hours__sun":"","open__mon":"0","open_hours__mon":"","open__tue":"0","open_hours__tue":"","open__wed":"0","open_hours__wed":"","open__thu":"0","open_hours__thu":"","open__fri":"0","open_hours__fri":"","open__sat":"0","open_hours__sat":"","open_hours":"","open_Sun":"0","open_hours_Sun":"","open_Mon":"0","open_hours_Mon":"","open_Tue":"0","open_hours_Tue":"","open_Wed":"0","open_hours_Wed":"","open_Thu":"0","open_hours_Thu":"","open_Fri":"0","open_hours_Fri":"","open_Sat":"0","open_hours_Sat":""},"Event":[]},{"Venue":{"id":"1151","region":"\u2028Lower Hutt\u2028","reference_num":"","aisle_number":null,"type":"","description":"We do everything we can to put our knowledge and passion into every single cup or sip because we believe that everyone, everywhere deserves great coffee.

In 2010 the Kelburn Village Pub was founded in its stead. While the Kelburn Village Pub is not a fine dining establishment, the winds of change always leave an imprint on tradition and the team upholds some of the traditions instilled here in the 1970s. This festival offering combines long-cherished dishes from different parts of the world adding a hint of something new and unexpected. Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington, earned the nickname the 'Iron Duke' for his traditional political fortitude, however, there is evidence that suggests he was more open-minded than his nickname suggests. This Festival Dish celebrates the more tender, worldly side of the Duke.","dish_name":"The Tender Duke","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5301","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-03-02 16:19:47","modified":"2022-05-04 14:22:14","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"601","venue_id":"332","reference_num":"","title":"Burger 2022","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"58","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/IMG_7328-220302-161947.jpg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5301-burger-2022","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"Cheese, sirloin mince","total_price_for_burger_beer_match":"38","select_your_garage_project_beer_match":"Chipper","has_beer_match":["Yes"],"does_your_burger_offering_cater_to_please_leave_blank_if_you_cannot_cater_to_these_dietaries":"","are_bookings_required":"Not required, but can be made","will_you_be_offering_your_burger_for_takeaway_orders":"Yes","are_you_happy_for_customers_to_share_burgers":"Yes","availability":["Dinner"],"burger_price":"25","burger_description":"Bocconcini stuffed sirloin patty with Choice Fruit Gin Pickled Cucumber, Greytown m\u0101nuka honey-glazed bacon, mozzarella, parmesan, and herb mayonnaise in an Arobake red milk bun, with smoked paprika steak fries","are_fries_included":["Yes -

American music was incredibly popular at the time due to a marked shift away from all things British. The Wellington Town Hall hosted regular dances in which \"young men performed backspins and dolphins\" to the cheering girls hoping to \u201cfill their dance cards\u201d, so they could in turn \"pump their knees and flap their arms like chicken wings\" to the popular tunes. Musicians like Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra - some of the greatest Italian American artists - carved out a new dance culture for Wellington's youth. Nolita's Festival Dish is a take on Italian food with a New York element, taking a classic dish from the 1950s and giving it a modern twist and shake - a plant based Wellingtonesque twist to the Italian classic osso bucco.","dish_name":"That's Amore","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5280","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-03-02 15:21:23","modified":"2022-05-04 14:53:54","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"3321","venue_id":"1371","reference_num":"","title":"Burger Welly 2022","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"58","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/P1080722-220302-152123.jpeg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5280-burger-welly-2022","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"Vegan, Italian, classic, lasagne, New York, retro, comfort food","total_price_for_burger_beer_match":"35","select_your_garage_project_beer_match":"Chipper","has_beer_match":["Yes"],"does_your_burger_offering_cater_to_please_leave_blank_if_you_cannot_cater_to_these_dietaries":["Dairy Free","Nut Free","Vegan","Vegetarian"],"are_bookings_required":"Not required, but can be made","will_you_be_offering_your_burger_for_takeaway_orders":"Yes","are_you_happy_for_customers_to_share_burgers":"Yes","availability":["Lunch","Dinner"],"burger_price":"24","burger_description":"Lasagne topper patty with melted mozzarella, smoky mushroom facon tomato sauce, pickled zucchini, Caprese salad and sunflower seed pesto mayonnaise in a Shelly Bay garlic focaccia bun, with smoked olive salted gnocco fritto","are_fries_included":["Yes - Fries\/Side"],"what_is_the_main_protein_of_your_burger":["Veggie"],"name_of_burger":"La La La La Lasagne","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5290","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-03-02 15:41:33","modified":"2022-05-06 09:19:25","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"3321","venue_id":"1371","reference_num":"","title":"Cocktail Wellington Nolita 2022","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"57","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/P1080706-220302-154133.jpeg","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5290-cocktail-wellington-nolita-2022","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"Vegan, sour, gin, mocktail, sweet","is_your_cocktail_and_tapas_offering":["Dairy Free","Nut Free","Vegan","Vegetarian"],"price_of_mocktail_tapas_match":"22","description_of_mocktail_and_regionally_inspired_tapas_match":"Apple juice, sour cherry syrup, lemon juice and soda sour.

This is based on a traditional drink, usually consumed after Ramadan.\r\nWe will use the base recipe from our Superfast Jellyfish series of sours, and substitute the usual fruit with an apricot puree that we will make, and a splash of rose water.\r\n\r\nDate Barleywine - 10%\r\nThe big, thick, sweet boy at the end of the evening. We will make oleo saccharum (a sugar and orange peel syrup) to add at the end of the boil.\r\nWe will vac-pack vanilla, oak chips, dates and bourbon, let them marry for a month, and age the beer on this mixture.\r\n\r\nFood featured:\r\n\r\nCous Cous Table Beer\r\nSharing Mezze \u2013 Selection of well-known Middle Eastern delights.\r\n\r\nQamar Al-Din Sour\r\nPersian Lamb with Saffron and Barberry Rice\r\n\r\nDate Barleywine\r\nKataifi with Honey syrup & Sesame crumb","event_title":"An Evening with Jeroboam","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"5186","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"","iticket":null,"invoiced":false,"created":"2022-02-28 20:26:03","modified":"2022-05-19 14:11:33","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"1346","venue_id":"650","reference_num":"","title":"Burger Application for The Hudson","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"58","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/Wheel-of-Porktune-Burger---The-Hudson-220519-141133.png","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/5186-burger-application-for-the-hudson","sessions":[],"session_tickets":[],"keywords":"pork, pork burger, the hudson, taste explosion, coleslaw, pork shoulder, pulled pork","total_price_for_burger_beer_match":"33","select_your_garage_project_beer_match":"Chipper","has_beer_match":["Yes"],"does_your_burger_offering_cater_to_please_leave_blank_if_you_cannot_cater_to_these_dietaries":["Gluten Free_possible","Nut Free"],"are_bookings_required":"Not required, but can be made","will_you_be_offering_your_burger_for_takeaway_orders":"Yes","are_you_happy_for_customers_to_share_burgers":"No","availability":["Lunch","Dinner"],"burger_price":"23","burger_description":"Pulled pork shoulder with coleslaw and spicy, smoky or sour sauces and additional toppings to be decided based on what you spin, in Brezelmania milk bun, with beef fat fries","are_fries_included":["Yes - Fries\/Side"],"what_is_the_main_protein_of_your_burger":["Pork"],"name_of_burger":"Wheel of Porktune","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0}]},{"Venue":{"id":"52","region":"Wellington CBD\u2028","reference_num":null,"aisle_number":null,"type":"Food Truck","description":"The Hungry Monkey is a family owned and operated food truck, offering traditional Malaysian street food and delicious meals spun into the modern age.

But with the advent of television in the early 1960s coffee houses were on the decline. At the same time, liquor laws were relaxed following a licensing referendum in 1967, with hotels able to remain open until 10 pm and serve food. Restaurants became more sophisticated and appealing to the new, more affluent and well-travelled generation of the 1970s. The Library has taken inspiration from these heady days with their Festival Dish banoffee pie, meets a new-fangled culinary technique (in the 1970s that is), fondue.

Then it was just a single-storey, gabled building with attics above. Until the 1876 reclamation, it faced the beach and people walked, rowed or paddled here to slake their thirst and their appetite. William was a keen hunter and was often found in the hills around Wellington hunting wild boar and deer which he dutifully butchered for his wife to serve up at the pub much to the delight of punters. Mrs Couper would often use the wild pork for her Sunday roast, not quite a porchetta but much loved all the same. The shape of New Zealand was used as a marketing tool to attract Italian migrants with a 19th-century promoter of Italian immigration showing how New Zealand bears a resemblance to Italy, by turning it upside down with \"the foot end facing up\", Wellington was a popular choice to live for a lot of Italians hence the name of our dish. This porchetta dish is a nod to William and his wife and the Italians who immigrated to Wellington during this time to help make Wellington what it is today.","dish_name":"The Foot End Facing Up","general_sale_tickets_soldout":0},{"id":"4939","site_id":"5","facebook_tracking":"","link":"https:\/\/www.iticket.co.nz\/events\/2022\/aug\/vwoap-tora-collective","iticket":"30263","invoiced":false,"created":"2022-02-17 11:37:12","modified":"2022-05-19 13:58:57","views":"0","enabled":true,"review_status":"Approved","cancelled":false,"new_date":false,"postponed":false,"custom_label":null,"hidden":false,"finalised":true,"featured":false,"close_tickets_x_minutes_before":"30","user_id":"628","venue_id":"314","reference_num":"","title":"Long Lunch with Tora Collective","registration_fees":null,"event_type_id":"55","blurb":null,"content":null,"notes":null,"image":"https:\/\/goodcms.s3.amazonaws.com\/woap\/event\/WOAP22_ToraCollective_Hero-220323-101023.png","image2":null,"json":null,"tags":null,"soldout":false,"sellingfast":false,"weeklong":false,"multiday":false,"label":"","label_flag":"","label_hex":"","region":null,"public_link":"\/event\/view\/4939-long-lunch-with-tora-collective","sessions":["2022-08-06 1:00pm 4:00pm 185.00"],"session_tickets":[{"id":"34642","comp_tickets_required":"0","event_id":"4939","cost":"185.00","available":"60","sold":"0","date":"2022-08-06","start_time":"1:00pm","end_time":"4:00pm","open":true,"link":null,"alternate_text":"","modified":"2022-05-19 13:58:57","printed":false}],"2022-08-06":"1:00pm 4:00pm 185.00","lowest_price":"185.00","highest_price":"185.00","force_sold_out":"0","waitlist_link":"https:\/\/forms.gle\/mufKxcauFwoNEgX29","keywords":"","shared_seating":"Yes","kid_friendly":"No","dietary":"","category":["Chef Collab","Educational"],"one_sentence_description":"Bringing the Tora coast to your table, an unmissable long lunch with Tora Collective, Palliser Estate and The Thistle Inn","short_description":"Tora Collective is one of those kiwi stories that warms your heart.
